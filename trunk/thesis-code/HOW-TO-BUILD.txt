Here's how to get, build, and run SIMI. 

(Sorry that I don't have a proper build system... hang in there)



This requires you to have a subversion client and the Ant build system
installed on your machine. Once built, you will basically need a
tablet (of the Wacom variety, not the iPad variety).

1) Check out the entire six11utils project from Google code:

svn checkout http://six11utils.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ six11utils

2) Build six11utils with "ant jar". This generates the file
   build/six11utils.jar.

3) Check out SIMI from Google code:

svn checkout http://pen-ui.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/thesis-code simi

4) Copy six11utils.jar (the one you just built) into SIMI's lib
   directory. There is already one in there, but it is not up to date.

5) Build simi with "ant compile"

6) You may run it in various ways.

  a) Easiest (OS X only): build the app with "ant jarBundle", then
  execute the resulting file: build/Sketch It, Make It.app

  b) Use some fancy IDE like Eclipse. Run org.six11.sf.Main. This is
  what I usually do. It is helpful to add the argument
  "--no-debug-color".

  c) Run it from the command line. In simi's top directory invoke the
  'run' script, like this:

  ~/tmp/simi $ ./run
