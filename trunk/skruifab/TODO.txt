- Improve segmentation 

  * Change the modified MergeCF to use elliptical arcs rather than
    circular arcs to measure error.

  * measure error by distance to linear sub-segmentation of elliptical
    arc. Finding the true distance is hard, as it involves numeric
    root finding.

- Draw rectified bounds without artifacts. This means if there is an
  elliptical arc adjacent to a line (or anything, really) that they
  terminate at the same point.

- Fix merge bug near end points (the hook problem)

- Be able to replace ink with rectified segment (and reverse).

- Detect closed loops

  * Bonus points to apply delaunay triangulator to closed area and
    shade it so it is clear where the part boundaries are.
