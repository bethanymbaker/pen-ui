Bugs at the moment:

* Should use hairline vector thickness when generating PDF.

* Removing a segment that has constraints associated with it should
  remove or alter those constraints.

* Circular guide isn't being completely respected. Not sure why. Make
  two guide points, and use them as outer points. The resulting
  half-circle isn't completely on the guide circle for some reason.
				   
* Flow selection should use points on the smooth spline. After
  deforming the same section a few times the distance between the para
  points gets bigger, making it hard to make fine edits.
