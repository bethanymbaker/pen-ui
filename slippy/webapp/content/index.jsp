<div id="title">Olive: a web-based programming tool for sketches</div>

<p>Olive is an IDE for writing programs in a programming language
called Slippy (short for Sketching Language In Progress).</p>

<p>Often researches write clever algorithms to do something of
interest to others, but it can be hard for others to read and play with
the source code that implements those algorithms. This is not because
people are overly protective of their code (usually). When programmers
intend to write some interesting proof-of-concept code, cross-platform
support is usually pretty low on the list of priorities.</p>

<p>Slippy programs are stored online, and the source code can always
be viewed and edited by anyone. It is actually impossible to write a
Slippy program and keep it to yourself!</p>

<p>The IDE presented here is equipped with a sketching surface that
allows Slippy code to work with drawn input and create graphical output
based on it. While Olive doesn't currently have sketch recognition built
in, it is the hope that recognizers, rectifiers, and all manner of novel
interaction techniques might be developed with Olive.</p>
